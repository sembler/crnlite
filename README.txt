Overview

  The U.S. Climate Reference Network (USCRN) consists of 114+ stations developed,
  deployed, managed, and maintained by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
  Administration (NOAA) in the continental United States for the express purpose
  of detecting the national signal of climate change. The vision of the USCRN
  program is to maintain a sustainable high-quality climate observation network
  that 50 years from now can with the highest degree of confidence answer the
  question: How has the climate of the nation changed over the past 50 years?
  These stations were designed with climate science in mind.

  The USCRN provides quality-controlled data sets to the public for free.  These
  data sets can be found at https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/crn/qcdatasets.html.  Here
  you will find fixed-width formatted text files that contain various climate
  measurements.

  While plain text is a good format for distribution, it is some-what difficult
  for the average person to pick out the information that they are interested in.
  Enter CRNLite; a tool that assists with the retrieval and organization of USCRN's
  data, so that any person with moderate technical skills can make use of that data.
